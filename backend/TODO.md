# TODO
- [x] maven build runnable for cloud native
- [x] set up Dockerfile with chaingguard
- [x] set up texas and authentication, check latest practices
- [x] set up logback with logstash and masking
- [x] test api with mocked auth / no auth
  - [x] option1 stub authentication middleware in the test application
    - simplest, also we dont actually need to test the middleware
  - [ ] option2 mock texas client to always return a valid user.
    - more complex, but also more realistic, the texas client code is also tested
  - [ ] option3 create a mock server that simulates texas responses and point to its url
    - most complex, but also most realistic, the texas client code is also tested including serdes and error handling
- [x] set up docker compose with postgres
- [x] add health endpoint
- [x] add metrics endpoint
- [x] add postgres and migration
  - exposed with R2DBC
- [x] integrate with arbeidsgiver-altinn-tilganger
- [x] test with integration to other services like arbeidsgiver-altinn-tilganger, arena, gosys etc
  - [x] option 1 use externalServices available in ktor server tests
    - simplest, requires the client to be passed from test to app code
  - [ ] option 2 use mock server like wiremock or roll our own
    - more complex, but also more realistic, the client code is also tested including serdes and error handling
- [ ] validate input using shared json schema
- [ ] postgres backed event bus for work coordination
- [ ] set up github actions for build and test
- [ ] teamlogs
