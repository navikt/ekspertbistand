# EventBus

Design and usage of the in-repo EventBus used for durable, at-least-once event processing.

## Overview

- Events are stored in a relational database table `events`.
- Workers acquire events with `SELECT â€¦ FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to avoid races across pods.
- On completion, events are moved to `event_log` with a terminal status and removed from `events`.
- If a pod dies mid-processing, the event becomes eligible for re-processing after an abandonment timeout.

## Lifecycle

- publish(event): Insert into `events` with status PENDING, attempts=0.
- poll(): Atomically select the next eligible row and mark it PROCESSING, incrementing attempts.
  - Eligibility: status = PENDING, or status = PROCESSING and `processing_started_at` older than the abandonment timeout.
  - Uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so only one worker acquires a row.
  - On acquire: set `processing_started_at = now` and increment `attempts`.
- finalize(id, success): Insert into `event_log` with status COMPLETED/FAILED and delete from `events`.

### Sequence diagrams

Success and failure paths plus abandonment recovery.

    participant P as Producer
    participant EB as EventBus (DB)
    participant W as Worker
    participant R as Router/Handlers
    participant L as Event Log

    P->>EB: publish(event)
    Note over EB: events += {status: PENDING, attempts: 0}

    W->>EB: poll()
    activate EB
    EB-->>W: select next (row lock via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
    EB->>EB: set status=PROCESSING, attempts=+1, processing_started_at=now
    deactivate EB

    W->>R: route(event)
    alt success
      R-->>W: OK
      W->>EB: finalize(id, success=true)
      EB->>L: insert log(COMPLETED)
      EB->>EB: delete from events
    else failure
      R-->>W: error
      W->>EB: finalize(id, success=false)
      EB->>L: insert log(FAILED)
      EB->>EB: delete from events
    end

    Note over W: pod dies while PROCESSING
    W--xR: crash
    Note over EB: time passes
    W2->>EB: poll()
    EB-->>W2: select PROCESSING row where processing_started_at < now - timeout
    EB->>EB: attempts=+1, processing_started_at=now (re-acquired)
    W2->>R: route(event)
    R-->>W2: OK or error
    W2->>EB: finalize(...)
```

## Abandoned events

- Default timeout: 5 minutes (configured in code).
- Criteria: when status = PROCESSING and `processing_started_at < now - timeout`, the row is eligible to be re-acquired.
- Re-acquire effect: attempts is incremented and `processing_started_at` is refreshed to now.

## API (Kotlin)

- publish(event: Event)
- poll(): Event?  // non-blocking; returns null if none
- finalize(id: Long, success: Boolean)

Example worker loop:

```kotlin
while (isActive) {
    val ev = EventBus.poll() ?: run {
        kotlinx.coroutines.delay(10_000)
        continue
    }
    try {
        EventRouter.route(ev)
        EventBus.finalize(ev.id, success = true)
    } catch (e: CancelledException) {
        throw e
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        EventBus.finalize(ev.id, success = false)
    }
}
```

## Operational notes

- Monitor queue depth, attempts, processing latency, and failure rate.
- Consider a max attempts policy to shunt poison events to FAILED in `event_log`.
- Add the composite index noted above for scale.
